# Dice Game
## Description
A two player game that generates random dice faces each time a player clicks a roll button. The game keeps track of scores by implementing a hold button which saves scores. The Game checks if random dice face was a 1; 
if yes the turn is given to player 2 and a class is switched to indicate this. The first player to reach a 100 points wins. Used HTML & CSS to create the layout and used JavaScript to implement functionality through 
conditionals, event listeners and functions. Applied the DOM manipulation concept here.
